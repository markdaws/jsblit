Build:
- Open a terminal and type "make all" at the top level folder that contains the Makefile. This will:
  - Run the Google Closure Compiler on the source to minify the code and find any errors/warnings
  - Run jslint on the code to find any bad programming practices or mistakes
  - Generate the documentation from the jsdoc comments
  - Run the unit tests

After running the command there should be:
bin/jsblit.js
bin/jsblit-compiled.js


To modify code, after making a change run "make compile" and a new version of jsblit.js and jsblit-compiled.js will be generated. If you add a new JS file you will need to update the Makefile to reflect this change.


Examples:
 - There is an asteroid sample in src/samples/asteroids/index.html that shows how to use the 2D APIs.
